<p>Scan_script is a bash script I wrote for OSCP to automate port scanning and basic enumeration and run in parallel what can be. I wrote it in bash instead of python to practice bash scripting.</p>

<p>It would have been simpler to use python because of the asynchronous nature of running in parallel commands that can be run in parallel but I wanted to practice bash scripting.</p>

<p>You can find the source code and instructions on how to use it <a href="https://github.com/Plotkine/scan_script" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>

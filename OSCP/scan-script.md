<h1>ENUMERATION SCRIPT FOR OSCP</h1>

<h2>What is it?</h2>

<p><br>scan_script is a bash script I wrote for OSCP to automate port scanning and basic enumeration.</p>

<p><br>It would have been simpler to use python async functions (like <a href="https://github.com/Tib3rius/AutoRecon" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AutoRecon</a>), instead of bash "waits", to run commands in parallel, but I wanted to practice bash scripting.</p>

<p>Still, the script is very efficient as running in parallel what can be.</p>

<h2>How to use it?</h2>

<p><br>You can find the source code and instructions on how to use it <a href="https://github.com/Plotkine/scan_script" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>

<p>Scan_script is a bash script I wrote for OSCP to automate port scanning and basic enumeration.</p>

<p>I used bash <i>wait</i> command to implement asynchronicity althought it would have made more sense to use python async functions (like <a href="https://github.com/Tib3rius/AutoRecon" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AutoRecon</a> does), but I wanted to practice bash scripting. Still, the script is very efficient at running in parallel what can be.</p>

<p>Source code and instructions on how to use it <a href="https://github.com/Plotkine/scan_script" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>

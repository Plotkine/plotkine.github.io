<p>Scan_script is a bash script I wrote for OSCP to automate port scanning and initial services enumeration.</p>

<p>I used bash instead of python because I wanted to practice bash scripting. To implement asynchronicity I used the <i>wait</i> command. I am quite happy with the result as the script is very efficient at running in parallel what can be.</p>

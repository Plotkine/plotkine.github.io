<p>"now comes the graceful "zen-cracking" moment: Sit down with<br>
a dry Martini and Wodka (obviously only russian Wodka will<br>
do) and contemplate the printing of the various mutant<br>
locations. Feel, perceive, empathize! Look closely at the<br>
locations that have changed in the snap compares. Analyse,<br>
interpretate, evaluate." </p>

<p>"We are now very near to the crack... can<br>
you *feel* it? If not, prepare yourself a good Martini Vodka!<br>
This is the correct way to do it:<br>
 * Get a "highball" glass;<br>
 * Put some ice cubes inside it (2 or 3);<br>
 * Add Martini Dry (From Martini & Rossi). Fill to 1/3;<br>
 * Add Moskowskaja Wodka (the only real Vodka). Fill to 2/3;<br>
 * Add a zest of lemon (From Malta or Southern France);<br>
 * Add a green "sound" olive (from Italy or Israel);<br>
 * Add Schweppes Indian Tonic. Fill to the brim.<br>
Sit deeper and relax, sip slowly and *feel* where the code of the<br>
protection scheme you are cracking "moves"... It's like a<br>
current... a slow tide. If you still do not believe me, just try<br>
it."</p>

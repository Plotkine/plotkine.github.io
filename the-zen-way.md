<p>"now comes the graceful "zen-cracking" moment: Sit down with
a dry Martini and Wodka (obviously only russian Wodka will
do) and contemplate the printing of the various mutant
locations. Feel, perceive, empathize! Look closely at the
locations that have changed in the snap compares. Analyse,
interpretate, evaluate."

<p>"We are now very near to the crack... can
you *feel* it? If not, prepare yourself a good Martini Vodka!
This is the correct way to do it:
 * Get a "highball" glass;
 * Put some ice cubes inside it (2 or 3);
 * Add Martini Dry (From Martini & Rossi). Fill to 1/3;
 * Add Moskowskaja Wodka (the only real Vodka). Fill to 2/3;
 * Add a zest of lemon (From Malta or Southern France);
 * Add a green "sound" olive (from Italy or Israel);
 * Add Schweppes Indian Tonic. Fill to the brim.
Sit deeper and relax, sip slowly and *feel* where the code of the
protection scheme you are cracking "moves"... It's like a
current... a slow tide. If you still do not believe me, just try
it."

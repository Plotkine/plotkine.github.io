<p>"Mathematics, rightly viewed, possesses not only truth, but supreme beauty—a beauty cold and austere, like that of sculpture, without appeal to any part of our weaker nature, without the gorgeous trappings of painting or music, yet sublimely pure, and capable of a stern perfection such as only the greatest art can show."

<p>"It's like asking why Beethoven's Ninth Symphony is beautiful, if you don't see why, someone can't tell you. I know numbers are beautiful. If they aren't beautiful, nothing is."

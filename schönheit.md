<p>"Mathematics, rightly viewed, possesses not only truth, but supreme beauty—a beauty cold and austere, like that of sculpture, without appeal to any part of our weaker nature, without the gorgeous trappings of painting or music, yet sublimely pure, and capable of a stern perfection such as only the greatest art can show. The true spirit of delight, the exaltation, the sense of being more than man, which is the touchstone of the highest excellence, is to be found in mathematics as surely as in poetry. What is best in mathematics deserves not merely to be learnt as a task, but to be assimilated as a part of daily thought, and brought again and again before the mind with ever−renewed encouragement. Real life is, to most men, a long second−best, a perpetual compromise between the ideal and the possible; but the world of pure reason knows no compromise, no practical limitations, no barrier to the creative activity embodying in splendid edifices the passionate aspiration after the perfect from which all great work springs. Remote from human passions, remote even from the pitiful facts of nature, the generations have gradually created an ordered cosmos, where pure thought can dwell as in its natural home, and where one, at least, of our nobler impulses can escape from the dreary exile of the actual world."

<p>"It's like asking why Beethoven's Ninth Symphony is beautiful, if you don't see why, someone can't tell you. I know numbers are beautiful. If they aren't beautiful, nothing is."

<p>"Ma vie actuelle est exactement l'inverse d'un songe. Mon corps va, vient, agit, se trouve au milieu du fer, des canons, des hommes, traverse l'Europe au gré d'une puissance à laquelle j'obéis en la méprisant. Mon âme n'a nulle conscience de ces actes, elle reste fixe, plongée dans une idée, engourdie par cette idée, la recherche de l'Absolu, de ce principe par lequel des graines, absolument semblables, mises dans un même milieu, donnent, l'une des calices blancs, l'autre des calices jaunes!"
<i>Honoré de Balzac, La Recherche de l'Absolu.</i></p>

<p>"Music was my first love
And it will be my last
Music of the future
And music of the past
To live without my music
Would be impossible to do
In this world of troubles
My music pulls me through"
<i>John Miles, Music</i></p>
